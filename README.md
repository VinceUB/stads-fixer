Vincent's STADS Fixer
=====================

What it does
------------
Fixes the bug where you can't log into STADS if your AAU ID contains 
the domain.

How?
----
Reprogrammed the login button, so that before it submits all your 
login details, it snips off the login's domain. It's scuffed but it 
works.

Why is this even necessary?
